        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            With the rise of new technology in today's world, one of the goals of developing artificial
            intelligence is to aide medical professionals in making diagnosis. One of the biggest areas
            where artificial intelligence is being utilized is identifying cancerous cells.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, we utilized the Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis), 
            a labeled dataset of breast tumor images taken under a microscope. The goal 
            of our project was to engineer a computer vision model that could analyze patterns
            in the given images. With its pattern recognition, our model can accurately
            determine whether a tumor was malignant, as well as the type of tumor.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project showcases the development of a machine learning pipeline that can 
            identify benign and malignant breast cells.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Breast cancer is the most common cancer for women all around the world. It is 
            estimated that 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. While some types of tumors are benign, such as adenosis, fibroadenoma, phyllodes tumor, and tubular 
            adenoma tumors, others are malignant and must be treated imminently, including carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, 
            mucinous carcinoma, and papillary carcinoma. Detecting 
            the cancer cells early is crucial for improving the health of cancer patients before 
            it is too late. However, traditional methods like human examinations of histopathological 
            images are inefficient and subject to human error. These false positives and false 
            negatives may have an extremely negative impact on the lives of some women. As a result, 
            with the advancements of technology that came with time, machine learning models have 
            shown promise in being able to automate the process of classifying cancer cells in medical images.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, we aim to leverage machine learning to be able to assist cancer specialists 
            in identifying different cancer cells given microscopic images. By training our model to recognise 
            the different cell types, we hope to be able to help the medical field expand its use of AI assisted 
            diagnostics and make even greater contributions in medicine.

    <div class="question">
        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>
            To the untrained human eye, images of breast tumor cells are indifferentiable, 
            but a machine learning model undoubtedly can. To what extent can a trained 
            model identify types of breast tumors?
        </p>

    <div class="focus">
        <h2>Project Focus</h2>
        <p>
            This project focuses on testing differently structured models to identify certain types of breast cancer tumors in a given tissue sample. 
            We chose three models to test out: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a CNN structured as a U-Net, and a Vision Transformer.

    <div class="dataset">
        <h2>BreakHis Dataset</h2>
        <p>
            The BreakHis dataset contains 9109 images of breast tumor tissue that comes from 82 patients. Each image 
            is magnified by either 40x, 100x, 200x, or 400x. Each image is a 700X460 pixel, RGB, 8-bit depth, PNG image. 
            Additionally, images are separated into multiple types of benign and malignant tumors, with 2,480 benign 
            and 5,429 malignant images. The types of benign tumors are adenosis (A), fibroadenoma (F), phyllodes 
            tumor (PT), and tubular adenoma (TA), and the types of malignant tumors are carcinoma (DC), lobular 
            carcinoma (LC), mucinous carcinoma (MC), and papillary carcinoma (PC). The dataset collected samples for 
            imaging through partial mastectomy or excisional biopsy.
