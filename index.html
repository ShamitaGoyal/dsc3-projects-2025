    <h1>Identifying Benign and Malignant Cells in Microscopic Images</h1>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        With the rise of new technology in today's world, one of the goals of developing artificial
        intelligence is to aide medical professionals in making diagnosis. One of the biggest areas
        where artificial intelligence is being utilized is identifying cancerous cells.

        In this project, we utilized the Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis), 
        a labeled dataset of breast tumor images taken under a microscope. The goal 
        of our project was to engineer a computer vision model that could analyze patterns
        in the given images. With its pattern recognition, our model can accurately
        determine whether a tumor was malignant, as well as the type of tumor.

        This project showcases the development of a machine learning pipeline that can 
        identify benign and malignant breast cells.

    <h2>Question</h2>
    <p>
        To the untrained human eye, images of breast tumor cells are indifferentiable, 
        but a machine learning model undoubtedly can. To what extent can a trained 
        model identify types of breast tumors?
