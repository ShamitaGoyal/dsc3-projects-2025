        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            With the rise of new technology in today's world, one of the goals of developing artificial
            intelligence is to aide medical professionals in making diagnosis. One of the biggest areas
            where artificial intelligence is being utilized is identifying cancerous cells.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, we utilized the Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis), 
            a labeled dataset of breast tumor images taken under a microscope. The goal 
            of our project was to engineer a computer vision model that could analyze patterns
            in the given images. With its pattern recognition, our model can accurately
            determine whether a tumor was malignant, as well as the type of tumor.
        </p>

            This project showcases the development of a machine learning pipeline that can 
            identify benign and malignant breast cells.

        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>
            To the untrained human eye, images of breast tumor cells are indifferentiable, 
            but a machine learning model undoubtedly can. To what extent can a trained 
            model identify types of breast tumors?
