        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            With the rise of new technology in today's world, one of the goals of developing artificial
            intelligence is to aide medical professionals in making diagnosis. One of the biggest areas
            where artificial intelligence is being utilized is identifying cancerous cells.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, we utilized the Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis), 
            a labeled dataset of breast tumor images taken under a microscope. The goal 
            of our project was to engineer a computer vision model that could analyze patterns
            in the given images. With its pattern recognition, our model can accurately
            determine whether a tumor was malignant, as well as the type of tumor.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project showcases the development of a machine learning pipeline that can 
            identify benign and malignant breast cells.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Breast cancer is the most common cancer for women all around the world. It is 
            estimated that 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. While some types of tumors are benign, such as adenosis, fibroadenoma, phyllodes tumor, and tubular 
            adenoma tumors, others are malignant and must be treated imminently, including carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, 
            mucinous carcinoma, and papillary carcinoma. Detecting 
            the cancer cells early is crucial for improving the health of cancer patients before 
            it is too late. However, traditional methods like human examinations of histopathological 
            images are inefficient and subject to human error. These false positives and false 
            negatives may have an extremely negative impact on the lives of some women. As a result, 
            with the advancements of technology that came with time, machine learning models have 
            shown promise in being able to automate the process of classifying cancer cells in medical images.

    <div class="question">
        <h2>Question</h2>
        <p>
            To the untrained human eye, images of breast tumor cells are indifferentiable, 
            but a machine learning model undoubtedly can. To what extent can a trained 
            model identify types of breast tumors?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="focus">
        <h2>Project Focus</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, we aim to leverage machine learning to be able to assist cancer specialists 
            in identifying different cancer cells given microscopic images. By training our models to recognise 
            the different cell types, we hope to be able to help the medical field expand its use of AI assisted 
            diagnostics and make even greater contributions in medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
            We focused on testing differently structured models to identify certain types of breast cancer tumors in a given tissue sample. 
            We chose three models to test out: a convolutional neural network (CNN), a CNN structured as a U-Net, and a vision transformer.

        <p>
            Computer vision is a broad, umbrella term that many models fall under. However, in this project, we used ResNet, a pretrained convolutional neural network, provided
            by Torchvision. ResNet was built in 2015 for the purposes of image recognition, and will essentially serve as our goal for this project.

            U-Nets is another form of convolutional neural network, but employs a specific structure to improve performance. As in the name, U-Nets are structured in a u-shape, 
            due to the connections linking convolutional layers opposite of each other, while still being connected with adjacent layers. U-Nets are very widely used in 
            image generation models, such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, although it was originally created for biomedical image segmentation tasks similar to this project.

        <p>
            Vision transformers use a tokenization pipeline to process images. Similar to how large language models like ChatGPT use tokens to parse through words, 
            vision transformers tokenize patches of the image and treat them like tokens, decipher patterns and relationships between varying patches. Originally, they were designed
            as alternatives to convolutional neural networks, and are now seen to have higher ceilings than convolutional neural networks, with the drawback of data inefficiency.
            Vision transformers require large amounts of data to be accurate and are computationally expensive.

    <div class="methodology">
        <h2>Methodologies</h2>
        <h3>BreakHis Dataset</h3>
        <p>
            The BreakHis dataset<sup>[1]</sup> contains 9109 images of breast tumor tissue that comes from 82 patients. Each image 
            is magnified by either 40x, 100x, 200x, or 400x. Each image is a 700X460 pixel, RGB, 8-bit depth, PNG image. 
            Additionally, images are separated into multiple types of benign and malignant tumors, with 2,480 benign 
            and 5,429 malignant images. The types of benign tumors are adenosis (A), fibroadenoma (F), phyllodes 
            tumor (PT), and tubular adenoma (TA), and the types of malignant tumors are carcinoma (DC), lobular 
            carcinoma (LC), mucinous carcinoma (MC), and papillary carcinoma (PC). The dataset collected samples for 
            imaging through partial mastectomy or excisional biopsy.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Preprocessing and Transformations</h3>
        <p>
            We started by parsing the CSV file and generating image-label pairs that were then loaded into eight separate classes based on different factors. Each of the tumor 
            subtypes were assigned an integer class value 0 through 7. The eight different classes were then split into two general categories: 
            benign and malignant cells. Binary labels were created for the categorical benign and malignant cells. 
        </p>
        <p>
            During preprocessing and transformation, we resized the images to be a standard amount of pixels. We then applied PyTorch transformations in order to convert each 
            image to a tensor and then normalized them using ImageNet statistics in order to ensure compatibility with our PyTorch models. 
        </p>
        <h3>Training, Optimization, and Testing</h3>
        <p>
            All the models were trained, optimized 
            The models were then moved to the GPU in order to speed up the training process when available. 
            
            The model was trained over 30 epochs total, using the Adam optimizer (learning rate 1e-4) and cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification. While training each epoch, we ensured 
            to track both loss and accuracy on the training and validation dataset. To prevent overfitting, we included a learning rate scheduler 
            that reduced the learning rate whenever the validation loss was barely changing. We also incorporated early stopping in order to stop 
            the model from training when there was no improvement happening. After training, the model was evaluated using two different confusion 
            matrices: the 8 class matrix and the binary matrix.
        </p>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            After training, optimizing, and testing the three models, we created the same confusion matrices to compare performance. To compare performance, 
            we relied on confusion matrices, which allowed us to calcuate an important metric: recall.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mathematically, recall is the number of true positive predictions that your model made, divided by the total number of inputs that were actually positive.
            In the context of our project (and real world breast tumors), a high recall represents our model saying "yes, this tumor is malignant" when it actually is, while a low
            recall represents our model saying "no, this tumor is not malignant", when in reality, the tumor is malignant!
        </p>
        <h3>ResNet</h3>
        <p>
            The first model we built is a computer vision model pipeline using PyTorch and the dataset. We started by parsing the CSV file and 
            generating image-label pairs that were then loaded into eight separate classes based on different factors. Each of the tumor 
            subtypes were assigned an integer class value 0 through 7. The eight different classes were then split into two general categories: 
            benign and malignant cells. Binary labels were created for the categorical benign and malignant cells. 
        </p>
        <p>
            During preprocessing and transformation, we resized the images to all be 260x260 pixels. We then applied PyTorch transformations in order to convert each 
            image to a tensor and then normalized them using ImageNet statistics in order to ensure compatibility with the ResNet-18 pretrained model. 
            We used the convolution layers in the ResNet-18 model to automatically take out and learn important patterns from the images. The model 
            was then moved to the GPU in order to speed up the training process when available. The model was trained over 30 epochs total, using 
            the Adam optimizer (learning rate 1e-4) and cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification. While training each epoch, we ensured 
            to track both loss and accuracy on the training and validation dataset. To prevent overfitting, we included a learning rate scheduler 
            that reduced the learning rate whenever the validation loss was barely changing. We also incorporated early stopping in order to stop 
            the model from training when there was no improvement happening. After training, the model was evaluated using a precision, recall, 
            an F1-score, and 2 different confusion matrices: the 8 class matrix and the binary matrix.
